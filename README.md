Plant Disease Detection from Images
A comprehensive Streamlit application that allows users to upload images of plant leaves and accurately predict the presence and type of plant disease using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This project involves designing, implementing, and optimizing a solution that integrates machine learning, computer vision, and user interface development.
